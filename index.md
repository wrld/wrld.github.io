## About Me

Hi there. I am a Ph.D. candidate in [CUHK T Stone Robotics Institute (CURI)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-68b5cEvIE) from [the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)](https://cuhk.edu.hk/chinese/index.html), supervised by [Prof. Yun-hui Liu](https://www4.mae.cuhk.edu.hk/peoples/liu-yun-hui/). 

I obtained my B.Eng (Sep. 2017 - Jun. 2021) in Control Science and Engineering and Mechanical and Electronic Engineering from [Zhejiang University (ZJU)](https://www.zju.edu.cn/) with an honor degree at [Chu Kochen College](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/ckcen/). I was advised by [Prof. Yue Wang](https://ywang-zju.github.io/), [Prof. Yiyi Liao](https://yiyiliao.github.io/) and [Prof. Rong Xiong](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0097062) for my undergraduate research.

## Research Interests

I am interested in 3D scene understanding, 3D reconstruction, novel view synthesis and generative model under challenging situations like minimal invasive surgical scene, surgical autonomy. <span style="color:red">I am also seeking collaborations, please feel free to contact me if you are interested in my research!</span>
