## About Me

Hi there. I am a Ph.D. candidate in [CUHK T Stone Robotics Institute (CURI)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-68b5cEvIE) from [the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)](https://cuhk.edu.hk/chinese/index.html), supervised by [Prof. Yun-hui Liu](https://www4.mae.cuhk.edu.hk/peoples/liu-yun-hui/). 

I obtained my B.Eng (Sep. 2017 - Jun. 2021) in Control Science and Engineering and Mechanical and Electronic Engineering from [Zhejiang University (ZJU)](https://www.zju.edu.cn/) with an honor degree at [Chu Kochen College](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/ckcen/). I was advised by [Prof. Yue Wang](https://ywang-zju.github.io/), and [Prof. Rong Xiong](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0097062) for my undergraduate research.

## Research Interests

I am interested in 3D scene understanding, 3D reconstruction, and generative model under challenging situations like minimal invasive surgical scene, autonomous surgery. If you are interested in my research, please feel free to contact me.
